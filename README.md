# Network-Traffic-analysis
network traffic analysis system that can detect potential malicious  activity by  monitoring network traffic patterns.

 The system can use machine learning to classify traffic as
normal or suspicious, based on features like IP addresses, protocols, or packet size. It can be 
used to identify intrusions such as DDoS attacks or malware communication.

#To make tool more effective do some minor changes and connect the tool with wireshark to analysis on real-time communication.
